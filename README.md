# apidemov4
This is an updated version of the API Demo that uses our XML API to send reminders and get status back via text or call. Using the API is fairly easy. You can use the Webhook information for status updates as a better alternative to requesting message statuses one at a time.

The demo page lets you:

Retrieve your key using your Remindercall.com username/password.
Send texts.
Send voice calls.
Send Emails.
Get the status of a texts or calls.
The sample page is here: http://www.snapnotify.net/example/apidemov4.php

More information along with the Request and Response information is here: https://secure.remindercall.com/developers/api/xml/
